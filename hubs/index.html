<h1>Bentley Virtual Reunion</h1>
<p>This year, we're meeting in a virtual space via Mozilla's Hubs.</p>
<h2>Before you Join</h2>
<p>For the smoothest experience, make sure that you have <strong>headphones</strong> before you enter the room.</p>
<p>(If you can't find headphones, that's OK, but you'll have to keep your microphone turned off any time you're not talking.)</p>
<h2>Entering the Room</h2>
<p>Click the link in your email, or visit <a href="https://hub.link/">hub.link</a> and enter the six-digit code from the email. (Note that, to avoid being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/style/zoombombing-zoom-trolling.html">zoombombed</a>, this link should never be posted to a public place.)</p>
<p>Once you visit the link, you'll enter the Lobby.</p>

<p>From here, you can use the text box to send a short message letting people in the room know that you've arrived and are getting ready, but people in the room won't be able to see or hear you until you click the "Enter Room" button.</p>
<p>Once you click "Enter Room", you'll be presented with the default random name and avatar Hubs has picked out for you. Set your name (and optionally select an avatar via "Browse avatars"), then press "Accept".</p>

<figcaption>If you forget to change these, you can do it once you're in the room by clicking "Set Name and Avatar".</figcaption>

<p>Once you've set your avatar, you'll reach another junction designed for jumping into VR:</p>

<p>Assuming you don't have a virtual reality headset attached to your computer, click "Enter on Screen" to advance to the microphone setup. Click the gray microphone circle, then press whatever button the browser prompts you with to give the page access to your microphone.</p>

<p>This will take you to one last screen before you enter the room: you can speak to make sure that your microphone is working (the bottom of the gray microphone circle should turn blue when it hears audio), and click the speaker button on the right to test your audio.</p>
<p>Once you've made sure everything is working, press "Enter Now".</p>
